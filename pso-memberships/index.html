					<h3>Project Background</h3>
					<p>Pittsburgh Symphony Orchestra (PSO) Memberships is a free program to help people show support for the PSO and identify as a booster, without cost or commitment. The goal is to transition the way the venue operates in its relationship with its patrons from a for-profit-esque, transactional model to a community-building model through free memberships.</p>
					<br>
					<p>As part of a Service Design course at Carnegie Mellon University, this is a 10 week-long project working with the Pittsburgh Symphony Orchestra to understand the current experience of the PSO and to offer new concepts and demonstrations which provide value for a new and redesigned symphony orchestra.</p> 
					<br>
					<p>It was completed from October to December 2013.</p>

					<h3>Problem Statement</h3>
					<p>How might we re-envision the relationship and interaction between the PSO and multiple-concert attendees?</p>

				<h3>Design Process</h3>
						
					<h4>Current State: Service Modelling</h4>
					<p>We identified the flow of the client's current stakeholders and touchpoints, and the relational value they have with each other. We produced a customer journey map of how one engages with the service.</p>
						
					<div class="imgcaption">
						<img class="img-responsive mid" src="models.jpg">	
					</div>	
					
					<br>
						
					<h4>Competitive Analysis</h4>
					<p>We performed a competitive study of other symphonies to analyze how other symphonies currently offer programs to their customers as well as the process behind general subscription programs.</p>
						
					<h4>User Research</h4>
					<p>We conducted spot interviews, online surveys, and in-depth interviews to understand user attitudes about both systems.</p>
						
					<div class="imgcaption">
						<img class="img-responsive mid" src="user-study.jpg">				
					</div>	
						
						
					<h4>Co-Design Workshop</h4>
					<p>We presented our initial findings to PSO's patron service representatives and related staff members. They mapped out their programs and plans to aid us in our understanding.</p>
						
					<div class="imgcaption">
						<img class="img-responsive mid" src="co-design.jpg">
					</div>	
						
					<br>
					
					<p>From there, we analyzed PSO's current view of their own system and their customers by diagramming their chronological sales model and value flow model. Our prior user data and new findings supplemented an independent view of their system. We created personas of symphony-goers to represent our key audience, of which were included in our storyboards to conceptualize the redesigned scenario.</p>
						
					<br>
					
					<h4>Personas</h4>
					
					<p>We generated personas in the current and future systems to evaluate what one might hear, think, see, say, do, and feel.</p>
						
					<div class="imgcaption">
						<img class="img-responsive mid" src="persona.jpg">
					</div>
						
						
					<br>
						
					<h4>Current & Future Value Flow Models</h4>
					
					<p>What value do symphony-goers get? What value does PSO get? We were able to determine these as well as the other stakeholders in the system by creating the following diagrams.</p>
					
					<div class="imgcaption">
						<img class="img-responsive mid" src="currentfuture.jpg">
					</div>
						
					<br>

					<h4>Redesign</h4>
					
					<p>We came up with multiple touchpoints for the proposed redesign that shared our goals of increasing the engagement and value flow between patrons and the service provider: a revised phone strategy, personalized profile pages for individual customers, gifting postcards, and an iPad brochure app.
						
					<h4>iPad App Prototype Development</h4>
					<p>I produced 3 different prototypes. At the lowest fidelity level, I sketched different screens on 3x5 cards. I determined usability and heuristic issues by asking users to perform a think-aloud test using my interface. and modified my design to address them. I moved onto build a medium-fidelity design on Balsamiq, performed a second cycle of user testing. I repeated this process once again to move onto high-fidelity prototyping by programming using MXML/ActionScript on Flex, and ran a mock test on an iPad. 10 screens are included in the final design.</p>

					<h4>Prototyping and Testing</h4>

					<br>
					
					<h3>Deliverables</h3>
					
					<p>We produced several prototypes of our touchpoints. Aside from my iPad prototype, there were also a mock profile page, hospitality postcards, and a storyboard of our scenario.</p>
					
					<br>
					<h4>High-Fidelity iPad App</h4>
					<p>Based off 3 rounds of user testing, the final visual look reflects a minimalistic, modern look. Unwanted screens such as the survey were removed, since they defeat the purpose of establishing friendly relationships with potential customers. </p>

					<h4>Profile Page Mock-Up & Hospitality Postcards</h4>
					<p>Signing up to become a PSO member grants a person his or her own account on PSO's website. Here, one can easily access news to upcoming PSO events, invites from other members, community events, special promotions, and more. Hospitality cards are also sent to members' homes  as a sign of appreciation for being part of the community. They include a QR code that, once scanned, provides a free music download!</p>
